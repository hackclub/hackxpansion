## Key Features

- Resistor based module idnetification at start up
- [2" 240x320 ST7789 LCD panel](https://www.buydisplay.com/2-inch-ips-tft-lcd-display-ips-panel-screen-240x320-for-smart-watch)
- RP2354 MCU
- Easily adaptable [module standard](https://hackxpansion.dino.icu/docs/detailed/card)
- Rust firmware with [embassy](https://embassy.dev/) and [slint-ui](https://slint.dev/)

## Why?

I really like the idea of modules, and modular things, and making people work together, so I made this.

## PCB

The console has two 4 layer PCBs designed in KiCAD, a main-board and a daughter-board, designed for JLC's basic process.

## Making Your Own Modules

There are three simple steps to making your own module:

1. Design the module PCB in KiCAD
2. Design the module case in CAD
3. Write a driver for the module

There are detailed docs on the [hackxpansion website](https://hackxpansion.dino.icu/docs)

## Case

The case is designed in Autodesk Fusion, there are .f3z files in the hardware directory.

The models have parameters that can be adjusted to fit your needs.

## Shoutouts

Thank you so much for [Simon](https://github.com/NEOgHacking) who helped with the fanout of the RP, and also gave a ton of constructive feedback!!!!

## BOM for Console

This is for an order of 2 PCBA PCBs.

Also found in a [CSV file](hardware/hackxpansion/BOM.csv). Each component has an LCSC part number attached that can be used to find the component on the LCSC website.
