//! Module driver traits.
//!
//! A driver identifies its hardware through [`DriverMeta::ID`], consumes the
//! detected module's [`crate::gpio_bank::GpioBank`], initializes any buses it
//! needs, and publishes app-facing capabilities in a [`crate::registry::Registry`].

///
/// A two-button module can consume GPIO 0 and GPIO 1 and publish each button as
/// an independent resource:
